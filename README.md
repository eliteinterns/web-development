## ✨ Overview

Welcome to **EliteInterns** – your comprehensive resource for web development mastery! This repository combines structured learning materials, interactive library demonstrations, and real-world projects designed to accelerate your journey from intern to professional developer.

> ⚠️ This repository is designed for **learning and reference purposes** only. The code examples are optimized for clarity rather than production readiness.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

| Section | Description | Links |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Core Web Technologies** | Foundational knowledge and examples | [Explore](#-internship-notes-html-css-js-json) |
| **JavaScript Libraries** | Interactive demos of popular libraries | [Explore](#-featured-javascript-libraries) |
| **Mini-Projects** | Complete, real-world applications | [Explore](#-internship-mini-projects) |

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eliteinterns/web-development.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd web-development
```

### 2. Focus on a Specific Project or Library

Want to isolate a specific project or library? We've made it simple:

```bash
.\run-setup.bat
```

> 🧩 When prompted, enter the folder name from `Libraries/` or `Projects/` (e.g., `chart`, `business`, `validator`, etc.).
>
> This will:
>
> * Move that folder’s contents to the root directory
> * Delete all other files and folders
> * Rename the root folder to match the selected name
> * Automatically delete the setup script afterward

### 3. Run in the Browser

> No build tools required – just open any `index.html` file directly in your browser.

- **Projects**: `Projects/Project-Name/index.html`
- **Library demos**: `Libraries/Library-Name/index.html`
- **Learning materials**: Explore markdown or HTML files in respective folders

### 4. Using a Local Server (Optional)

For demos using `fetch()` or other features requiring a server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server

# Or simply use VS Code's Live Server extension
```
